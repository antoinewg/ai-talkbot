# AI talkbot

## Demo

If you want to test it live, you'll have to clone the repo because I didn't set up the api keys for the public demo.

## Architecture

Might seem more complex (and it is) but now you have a Talkbot instead of a Chatbot ðŸŽ‰.

## Notes

Why not [OpenAI's realtime](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) ?
> Loosing realtime but gaining control over the AI agent (currently just a chatbot but picture it with tools).

Why ElevenLabs for Text-to-Speech and Deepgram for Speech to Text ? Because they're fast and good enough.

## Getting Started

First, copy paste the `.env.example` into a `.env.local` and provide the API keys.
Then, install `pnpm i` and run the development server `pnpm dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
